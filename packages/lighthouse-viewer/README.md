# Lighthouse Viewer
This is the code extracted from the [lighthouse original repository](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/tree/master/lighthouse-core/report/html)
and packaged as an ES Modules for convenience and tree shaking.
 
The code for this repository **is automatically generated every time is built**, copying the files, adding the `imports` 
and `exports` for every file.

This is only for convenience, and it would be cool if some day the people from Lighthouse could export this code as well.

## Getting started

1. Install it using `npm i lighthouse-viewer`
2. In your code, import the following modules:

```ts
import { renderReport } from 'lighthouse-viewer';
import report from './static/report.json';

const app = document.querySelector<HTMLDivElement>('#lighthouse-viewer-element')!;

const reportHtml = renderReport(report as any, {});
app.appendChild(reportHtml);
```

3. And in your HTML

```html
<div>
  <main class="lighthouse-viewer"></main>
</div>
```
