# Lighthouse Viewer Monorepository

This is a monorepo-multipackage managed with Lerna to publish to NPM the following packages:

- `lighthouse-viewer`: The extracted sourcecode originally from [lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse).
- `vue-lighthouse-viewer`: A wrapper of the lighthouse-viewer for Vue 2.
- `demo`: A small demo of the code working

The idea is by following this pattern to be able to create wrappers to other libraries too.


## TODO
